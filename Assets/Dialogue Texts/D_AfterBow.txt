Now I have a way to shoot at those birds! 
I haven’t touched a bow since my middle school camping trip...man I want to go home.
Well, with any luck I can have bird meat for dinner. I only have a few arrows though, so I’ll have to make every shot count. (At least no one’s here to see my B- archery skills)
