Now I have a way to shoot at those birds! 
I haven’t touched a bow since my middle school camping trip...
...Feeling a little homesick now.
Well, with any luck I can have bird meat for dinner. 
I only have a few arrows though, so I’ll have to make every shot count. 
(<i>At least no one’s here to see my B- archery skills</i>)
