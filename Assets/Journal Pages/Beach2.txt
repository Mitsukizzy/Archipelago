Day 19:
We've been at this for almost three weeks now, nothing has been too out of the ordinary. We've made good progress mapping out islands and taking notes as we progress further into the archipelago. The channels between islands have become too treacherous for our boat, so we had to make a smaller one out of wood. We've been setting up campsites on the islands as we pass through so we have a place to stay on our way back.
