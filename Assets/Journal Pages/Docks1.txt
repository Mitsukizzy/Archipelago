Day 24:
We came across something very peculiar today, it seems these islands weren't as unexplored as we thought. We found an old abandoned dock with a few old skiffs that look like they haven't been maintained in years. If there are - or were - people on these islands Saaristo Corp  will surely want to know about it.
