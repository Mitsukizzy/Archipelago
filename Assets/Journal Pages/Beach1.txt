Day 1:
The team and I have just set sail for the inner islands. We were hired by the Saaristo Corp to survey the land and take records of the fauna and flora. They are planning on expanding their research center to more of the islands and need to get more information before they start. I'm not exactly sure what I'm getting myself into, hopefully it'll be like a paid vacation on some tropical islands.
